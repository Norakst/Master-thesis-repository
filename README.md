This repository comprises the main scripts in my master's thesis; data preprosessing, PSN-implementation, network fusion, network evaluations and statistical analyses. 

Some of the code is written on the TSD server (Tjenester for Sensitive Data, UiO), where the data is located and sealed, and some code is written outside. The environments and program/package versions are not the same, 
resulting in some deviations in package function utilization. The data is sensitive and thus the script cannot be ran.
