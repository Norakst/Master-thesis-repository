This repository comprises the main scripts of my master's thesis; data preprosessing, PSN implementation, network fusion, network evaluations and statistical analyses. 

Some of the code is written on the TSD server (Tjenester for Sensitive Data, UiO), and then exported. Some code is written outside this server as well. The environments and program/package versions are not identical, resulting in some deviations in package function utilization. 

Due to the sensitivity of the data, and environmental deviations, it is not possible to run the script for testing purposes.
